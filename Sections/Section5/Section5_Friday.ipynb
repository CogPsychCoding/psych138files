On the low end of the list, you are going to replace the first `trim` values with the value at the `trim + 1` position. On the high end of the list, you are going to replace the last `trim` values with the value at the `trim - 1` position. This process of replacing the extreme values on either end of a sample with the value just before those extremes is called winsorization.\n",
