It was something that took up most of my afternoons and weekends, as we would practice for hours on end to perfect our arguments and public speaking skills. The debates themselves were exhilarating; it felt like a battle of wits where the stakes were high, and every victory brought immense satisfaction.\n",

Balancing schoolwork, family life, friendships, and my own personal interests became increasingly difficult as the debate team consumed more and more of my time. Additionally, I started noticing that the environment within the team was becoming toxic; there were constant power struggles between members, and it seemed like no one could agree on anything.\n",
            "\n",
            "This led to a lot of internal conflict for me - I loved the intellectual challenge and the adrenaline rush that came with debating, but I also valued my other relationships and interests outside of this activity. It became clear to me that I couldn't sustain such an intense commitment indefinitely without sacrificing something important in my life.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately, I decided to quit the debate team because it was no longer a healthy or balanced part of my life. The time I had been devoting to debating could be better spent on other pursuits that were equally fulfilling but less draining. It was a difficult decision, as I looked back at all the memories and friendships formed through this activity, but in the end, it was necessary for me to prioritize my overall well-being and mental health.\n",
